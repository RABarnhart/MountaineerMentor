Accessability information
    Appalachian State University is dedicated to providing the best experience possible to all individuals by providing an inclusive and accessible campus environment. This site is intended to provide accessibility information, guidance and tools for the campus community.\
        Accessible means a person with a disability is afforded the opportunity to acquire the same information, engage in the same interactions, and enjoy the same services as a person without a disability in an equally effective and equally integrated manner, with substantially equivalent ease of use.

        The person with a disability must be able to obtain the information as fully, equally and independently as a person without a disability. Although this might not result in identical ease of use compared to that of persons without disabilities, it still must ensure equal opportunity to the educational benefits and opportunities afforded by the technology and equal treatment in the use of such technology.

        ~ From a recent U.S. Department of Education (DoE) Resolution Agreement

        Why accessibility matters
        Accessibility removes barriers and provides the ability for everyone, regardless of disability, to access, use and benefit from programs, services and activities.

        Consistent with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), it is the policy of Appalachian State University that no qualified individual with a disability in the United States shall be excluded from, denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity.

        Who accessibility benefts
        Accessibility efforts benefit all users!

        Power assisted doors are necessary for individuals with mobility impairments. They also benefit a person carrying a bulky item or an individual pushing a stroller.
        Captioning not only helps those who are hard of hearing/deaf to access audio information, but can reinforce verbal material and increase comprehension for ESL learners, non-traditional students, and visual learners.
        Websites with clear, consistent and organized design will benefit individuals using screen readers. They also allow easier navigation and are more visually appealing to everyone.

App State Facts
    Appalachian State University was founded 125 years ago to increase access to education for those in North Carolina’s “lost provinces.” Today, we are a premier public institution — a thriving university that remains true to our mission as a rural-serving institution. We are known for small class sizes that allow for high-quality student and faculty interaction, excellent undergraduate research opportunities and service to our local and regional communities.

    From the Mountains to the Valley
    App State’s Boone and Hickory campus locations, in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Catawba Valley, profoundly shape how our campus communities live, work and learn together. Our commitment to sustainability is a tradition, not a trend, and App State is an active steward of North Carolina’s interconnected economic, cultural and natural resources.

    This commitment shows in many ways, including our tuition rates, textbook rental program, commitment to energy efficiency, economic viability and equitable citizenship. Because of this and much more, App State is consistently recognized among the "Best" and "Top" colleges in the nation and the Southeast, according to such national publications as U.S. News & World Report, The Princeton Review, Forbes magazine and Money.com.

    Comprehensive Degree Offerings
    App State offers more than 150 undergraduate and 80 graduate degree programs through its College of Arts and Sciences, College of Fine and Applied Arts, Reich College of Education, Walker College of Business, Hayes School of Music, Beaver College of Health Sciences, University College and Williams School of Graduate Studies. App State also offers doctorate degrees in education and psychology.

    Undergraduate Research
    App State encourages opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in research projects alongside their professors. Their work is showcased during the annual Celebration of Student Research and Creative Endeavors held on the Boone campus, as well as at professional conferences in the region and across the United States.

    A Bachelor’s to Master’s Plan that Makes Sense
    Many of our undergraduate students choose to build upon their undergraduate work — while saving tuition dollars — with App State’s Accelerated Master’s program. It allows undergraduate students to enroll in graduate courses during their senior year and earn both a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree from App State in about five years.

    Graduate Studies
    App State offers 80 graduate degree and certificate programs, which prepare our students for success in the workforce as well as in life. Under the mentorship of their professors, our graduate students often conduct primary research, are published and present at professional conferences.

    A Sustainable Mission
    App State’s leadership in sustainability is known nationally. Our three-branched approach asks us to consider if actions are sustainable economically, environmentally and equitably in relationship to our planet’s co-inhabitants. These three areas often intersect to create a deep and real sustainability. Such commitment to research, creativity, innovation and practice is making a difference now and for our future.

    Community and Civic Engagement
    App State is recognized nationally in the areas of community and civic engagement and service-learning. The intersection of classroom learning and real-world experience is a powerful combination. This work sets us apart from other institutions and leads us all to value how our lives, no matter our professions, can become more meaningful by serving others. App State’s commitment to service is evidenced across campus and beyond, which led to a community engagement classification by the Carnegie Foundation.

    Student Health and Safety
    A safe and healthy environment is key to our students’ ability to focus on their education and all the experiences that will positively shape a transformational App State Experience. App State’s tradition of caring for students is a deep and broad commitment — one that extends throughout our entire community.

    Global Proficiency
    At App State, our students engage in multiple and varied experiences — both at home and abroad — to increase their knowledge of global issues, regions and cultures, improve their intercultural skills and demonstrate global citizenship.

    The Desire to Educate
    Appalachian State University began as Watauga Academy, founded in 1899 by Dr. B.B. Dougherty, his brother D.D. Dougherty, and D.D.’s wife, Lillie Shull Dougherty. They shared the dream of helping children in North Carolina’s “lost provinces” discover educational opportunity to match the splendor of the mountains in which they lived.

    This tiny academy quickly evolved into a school preparing quality teachers to serve our state and beyond. Building on this strong foundation, Appalachian grew into a destination of choice for high-achieving, intellectually curious students wanting to be engaged in the community.

    The Early Years
    Known as one of North Carolina’s greatest educators, B.B. Dougherty led the institution for 56 years – from its humble beginnings as Watauga Academy to Appalachian Training School for Teachers, the two-year Appalachian State Normal School and later the four-year Appalachian State Teachers College. The pioneering spirit necessary to overcome the area’s isolation and hardships quickly characterized the institution, giving Appalachian its special niche in higher education.

    Growing into a University
    Dr. William H. Plemmons (1955-69) presided over Appalachian’s transformation from a single-purpose teachers college into a multipurpose regional university. Yet, the precious features that set Appalachian apart – quality teacher training and a commitment to community spirit, faculty collegiality, and a beautiful mountain setting – remained secure under his leadership.

    Known as the builder president, Plemmons oversaw 25 construction projects and strengthened the Appalachian spirit through enhanced activities for students and alumni, creating an interconnected community called the Appalachian Family.

    When fire destroyed the administration building in 1966, it symbolized the demise of the old Appalachian and birth of the new. Enrollment exceeded 2,400 by 1958, only to double within 10 years. Full-time faculty grew to more than 300 and became more diverse. During his tenure, Appalachian also began offering master’s-level programs.

    Nationally Recognized for Innovation
    The university became part of the University of North Carolina system in 1971 under the leadership of Dr. Herbert W. Wey (1969-79). He introduced innovations that earned Appalachian national recognition as an institution of change, all while enrollment doubled to about 9,500.

    Under his leadership, Appalachian implemented the student teacher program, College of Business, continuing education program and Watauga College, a small residential college within the greater university. It also secured the New York Loft and App House in Washington, D.C., for off-campus scholarly activities. To ensure the university’s continued innovation and success, Wey created the Appalachian State University Foundation Inc. to solicit support from individuals, corporations and businesses.

    Wey was a prolific writer and researcher. Peers referred to him as the “educational innovator” for encouraging faculty to develop and practice new theories of teaching and learning.

    A Leader in Technology and International Education
    Dr. John E. Thomas (1979-93) recruited a first-rate faculty, believing that strong, effective teaching should be supported by research and community service. With a focus on improving campus technology and blending it into teaching, Thomas also developed Appalachian’s leadership in distance learning, which expanded in the late 1990s and early 2000s to include a formal partnership with 10 regional community colleges. Under Thomas’ leadership, Appalachian developed exchange programs in a dozen countries including China, Germany and Costa Rica.

    The focus on international education continued with Dr. Francis T.Borkowski (1993-2003), who entered his chancellorship with a respectful vision: to create a distinctive learning environment sensitive to rapid world changes, such as technology and globalization, yet rooted in mountain values and Appalachian’s tradition of teaching, scholarship and service.

    In May 2003, President Molly Broad appointed Dr. Harvey R. Durham as acting chancellor after 24 years of service as the university’s chief academic officer and 14 years prior as professor, department chair and associate vice chancellor. Dr. Durham served as acting chancellor for the school year 2003-04.

    The results of these leaders’ progressive changes garnered recognition for Appalachian in U.S. News & World Report and other publications as a top comprehensive university. The university’s emphasis on international education led the American Council on Education to recognize Appalachian as a model institution for international studies, while programs such as Freshman Seminar, now called First Year Seminar, freshman learning communities and the Summer Reading Program prompted TIME magazine to name Appalachian a “College of the Year” in 2001.

    A Destination of Choice
    Under the leadership of Dr. Kenneth E. Peacock (2004-14), Appalachian became a destination of choice for high-achieving, intellectually curious students wanting to be engaged in the community.

    In addition to small classes and challenging academics, Appalachian became known for its undergraduate research, internationalized curriculum, service-learning and sustainability, both in academic programs and campus practices. The university grew significantly in the areas of healthcare and the nexus of energy, the environment and economics. It received increased national attention for its academics, as well as its three national NCAA football championships in 2005, 2006 and 2007.

    At the time Dr. Sheri Everts joined Appalachian in July 2014, enrollment had topped 17,800 and the university was attracting international attention with its entry in the Solar Decathlon Europe 2014 competition in Versailles, France, and students’ exhibition of designs in the Milan Furniture Fair. Appalachian was also preparing to host its third annual Appalachian Energy Summit, at which leaders from North Carolina’s public and private universities convene to share best practices. On Chancellor Everts’ first day in office, Appalachian joined the NCAA’s Division I FBS, and in 2015, Mountaineer football brought home a record-setting win at the FBS Camellia Bowl. Under her leadership, Appalachian welcomed the most diverse first-year class in university history.

    Under Everts’ leadership, Appalachian has distinguished itself as the premier public undergraduate institution in the state of North Carolina. By ensuring a sound foundation in terms of the university’s physical infrastructure and the goals and strategic initiatives that empower human potential, Appalachian provides the highest quality setting in which students can grow and learn how to navigate life successfully. Specifically, between 2014 and 2019, enrollment grew to more than 19,000 and, of the undergraduate population, the university increased underrepresented students by 48%, first-generation students by 79% and rural students by 10% (in-state, degree-seeking students who are from Tier 1 and Tier 2 counties, as designated by the North Carolina Department of Commerce). In 2017, Everts launched the Chancellor’s Innovation Scholars Program to support research and practice related to the innovation of higher education. In 2018, she led the charge in opening the Appalachian State University Academy at Middle Fork in Walkertown, North Carolina — which serves approximately 300 K–5 students with research-based practices, state-of-the-art literacy instruction, and exemplary classroom instruction and administration — and cut the ribbon on the new Leon Levine Hall of Health Sciences. The university continues to be a leader in sustainability, in part by hosting the annual Appalachian Energy Summit — a platform through which UNC System campuses have worked together to avoid more than $924 million in utility costs.

    Chancellor Everts’ priorities for moving forward as a campus community include:
        - articulating the ways Appalachian defines sustainability;
        - increasing the diversity of our student, faculty and staff populations;
        - improving wellness, health and safety for our campus community;
        - integrating global learning into and beyond our classrooms;
        - supporting faculty and staff;
        - providing innovative and creative opportunities for our students to engage in and showcase their research;
        - emphasizing the significance of the difference we can make in communities here and across the world through civic engagement;
        - securing the necessary resources to energize and sustain these strategic initiatives and support our world-class faculty, staff and students; and
        - maintaining a focus on slow and steady enrollment growth.

Chancellor's Messages
    Remarks from the March 15, 2024 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, March 15, 2024
    Thank you, Chair Ricks, and good afternoon, everyone!

    After some lovely spring weather in Boone and Hickory last week, our students and faculty are on Spring Break, earning some much-needed recharging time so they can finish the semester strong.

    I just returned from Pensacola, Florida, and the 2024 Sun Belt Conference Basketball Tournament — Trustee Chesson and Trustee Wyatt, it was good to see you there — thank you for joining us! We had a great turnout in Pensacola, as Mountaineers showed up in force to support our men’s and women’s basketball teams during the Sun Belt Conference Tournament. Both teams fought hard, and they will definitely be back next year! I’d like to thank everyone who traveled to support our teams and Coach Kerns and Coach Elderkin. A huge thanks to our Hayes School of Music Basketball Band — they were amazing — who brought their heartfelt support, passion and tremendous talent, adding to a great fan experience on the road.

    Remarks from the December 8, 2023 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, December 8, 2023
    Thank you, Chair Ricks, and good afternoon, everyone!

    With one week until December Commencement, we’re looking ahead to App’s 125th birthday, as we reflect on an incredible 124th year.

    But before I begin my remarks today, I would like to acknowledge the passing of Chancellor Kenneth E. Peacock in October.

    As Chancellor of our university for 10 years, from 2004 to 2014, Ken established the university as a leader in undergraduate research, grew our academic enterprise significantly in the areas of health care, establishing the College of Health Sciences, opened a new building for the Reich College of Education, led significant growth in the nexus of energy, the environment and economics, and moved our athletics programs to the Sun Belt Conference and the Football Bowl Subdivision, all while growing enrollment and solidifying our reputation as a national leader in undergraduate education.


    Remarks from the September 29, 2023 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, September 29, 2023
    Thank you, Acting Chair Ricks, and good afternoon!

    It's hard to believe it's nearly October already! It's been a very busy beginning to the semester, and I thank you all for the many events you have joined us for since the semester began just over a month ago.

    The first day of classes represents new beginnings for students, faculty and staff, and it's always full of promise and excitement.

    Good morning and welcome to a very exciting weekend on App State’s Boone campus!

    Sunday night, I returned from College Station, Texas, after our football team won a tremendously important game for App State, beating Texas A&M, who was, at the time, ranked sixth in the nation. This week, College GameDay, ESPN’s popular college football pregame show, is broadcasting from App State’s campus for the very first time.

    Remarks from the June 17, 2022 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, June 17, 2022
    Good morning and welcome to our beautiful Boone campus! We have a gorgeous summer day outside and a lovely weekend ahead. I hope you will be able to get outside.

    I’d like to begin by extending a special welcome to our newest board member: 
    Anita Greene. With a background in mechanical engineering, Anita is an entrepreneur and owner of Artisanal Restaurant in Banner Elk and Peppervine in Charlotte, and she brings significant business experience to this board.

    Also, we are welcoming Quson Brown, who is our student Trustee. Congratulations on your appointments to the Board — I look forward to working more closely with you both, and thank you in advance for your service.

    Thank you, also to Sarah-Davis Cagle, our newest constituency member. Sarah-Davis became Chair of App State’s Staff Senate earlier this week. 

    When this board met in March, we had national searches underway for the Vice Chancellor of Finance and Operations (formerly Business Affairs), Chief Diversity Officer and Chief Audit Officer positions. I am pleased to report each of those searches has been filled, and the new appointees are with us here today.


    Remarks from the June 14, 2022 Staff Senate Meeting
    Tuesday, June 14, 2022
    Good afternoon, and thank you for the opportunity to join your meeting today to share some key university updates.

    Before I begin, I would like to thank Clint for his service over the last year, and welcome Sarah-Davis into her new role as Chair. Thank you both for your continued commitment to excellence and for your representation of App State’s fabulous staff members.

    While many students and faculty take a break over the summer months, you all are working harder than ever. I appreciate and value your work — thank you!

    In the last few weeks, we have completed three national searches, and hired:

    Dan Layzell, our new Vice Chancellor of Finance and Operations. Dan begins in his role at App State on Aug. 15, and will run the Division of Finance and Operations, formerly known as Business Affairs;

    Jamie Parson, who has done an extraordinary job in the position of Interim Chief Diversity Officer, has been named to the position permanently; and

    Jennifer Myers was hired to fill the position of Chief Audit Officer. Jennifer works within the new Division of Institutional Integrity, led by General Counsel Paul Meggett.

    As shared by Jamie Parson, this week, the university will commemorate Juneteenth with programming that includes a Unity Vigil honoring the victims and survivors of recent mass shooting events and a “lunch and learn” event with Rodney Dawson, the education curator at the Greensboro History Museum. I hope you will join this first universitywide commemoration of Juneteenth, and I appreciate the work of the many staff who are ensuring the university’s recognition of this important day in our nation’s history.


    Dan Layzell named Vice Chancellor of Finance and Operations
    Tuesday, May 24, 2022
    Dear Members of the App State Community,

    I am pleased to announce that after a national search, I have named Dr. Dan Layzell to the position of Vice Chancellor of Finance and Operations, effective August 15.

    Dan currently serves as Vice President, Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer/Treasurer of Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa. He brings a career of nearly three decades in higher education and a decade of policy and legislative experience to this role, as well as classroom experience as teaching faculty.

    As Vice Chancellor of Finance and Operations, formerly known as Vice Chancellor of Business Affairs, Dan will be responsible for administrative oversight of finance and administration, campus services, facilities management and human resources.

    Tuesday, May 17, 2022
    Dear Members of the App State Community,

    I am pleased to announce that after a national search, I have named Jamie Parson to the position of Chief Diversity Officer, effective immediately.

    In the last year, since I appointed Jamie Interim Chief Diversity Officer, she has led many important diversity, equity and inclusion accomplishments for App State. Her work has included promoting transparency in policies and expectations, continuing to enhance the university’s evaluative methods, disaggregating data to assist with making data-driven decisions, advancing professional development and networking opportunities, and partnering with numerous individuals and units across the university to implement unit-level and campuswide diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.


    Remarks from the April 25, 2022 Faculty Senate Meeting
    Tuesday, April 26, 2022
    Thank you, Louis, and good afternoon. I'm pleased to join you for your final meeting of the 2021-22 academic year and share a university update.

    This Senate diligently serves as the instrument through which the App State faculty considers and acts on university matters, and I appreciate your dedication to this important work. The end of the academic year is often a time for reflection, and I encourage you to take this opportunity to celebrate your many successes. Thank you for all you do for our students.

    Good morning. There is much to report today, and I appreciate your indulgence as I share some of the incredible progress and success we have had so far this year.

    Today marks the 800th day since we first began planning, preparing and responding to COVID.  I am so proud of how our staff, faculty and students came together as a community to persevere. Together we managed the most significant crisis our university has ever faced. While we certainly didn’t all agree at all times, we kept our focus on making data-driven decisions and our goal — always — was to do what was best for our students.


    March 22 Virtual Town Hall — UNC System Strategic Plan
    Wednesday, March 16, 2022

    Budget Update from Chancellor Sheri Everts
    Tuesday, November 16, 2021
    Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

    Budget news from Raleigh looks promising as the North Carolina legislature has a final two-year budget bill moving through the General Assembly and Governor Cooper has announced he will sign it into law. We expect to have a State budget by the end of the week. There is much to celebrate in this budget, and it represents an incredible amount of work on behalf of our legislators and our Governor.


    Important COVID-19 vaccine update
    Monday, October 25, 2021
    I am sure many of you have heard of President Biden’s recent vaccine mandate associated with federal contracts. Like our higher ed colleagues in North Carolina and across the country, we are reviewing the guidance and its implications for our employees.

    Remarks from the Fall 2021 Faculty and Staff Meeting
    Friday, October 8, 2021

    Remarks from the September 24, 2021 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, September 24, 2021
    Good afternoon, and thank you, Chair Lampe, for your leadership of this Board.

    I’d like to begin my remarks today by acknowledging the contributions of former Chancellor John Thomas, who passed away at the beginning of the month. Chancellor Thomas was a beloved member of our campus community who served as chancellor of App State from 1979–1993. He championed the importance of teaching and research going hand-in-hand, and his legacy of innovation and service will remain a central aspect of our campus culture for generations to come. Those who were fortunate to know him remember him as kind, thoughtful and community-focused. He was my trusted mentor and dear friend, and he will forever occupy a special place in my heart and in the heart of our campus community.


    Remarks from September 13, 2021 Faculty Senate Meeting
    Monday, September 13, 2021
    Good afternoon, and thank you, Louis.

    I’d like to begin by thanking you for your collaborative leadership and partnership, which began within minutes of your election as the new Faculty Senate Chair.

    Remarks from the August 19, 2021 Team Sunergy celebration
    Thursday, August 19, 2021

    Remarks from the June 18, 2021 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, June 18, 2021
    It has been a productive two days and I know we have all enjoyed being together with more in-person meeting interaction than this board has had since December of 2019. I appreciate your continued dedication to App State, and share your excitement as the COVID-19 vaccine is offering us the ability to move into a post-pandemic reality.


    Dr. Heather Hulburt Norris named Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor
    Friday, May 7, 2021
    Dear Members of the App State Community,

    I am very pleased to announce that Dr. Heather Hulburt Norris will assume the role of Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, effective immediately.

    Since February of 2020, Heather has served in this role in an interim capacity, and her leadership throughout the pandemic has been exceptional. She has risen to each challenge, building consensus, leading by example and fostering innovation and creative solutions under immensely difficult circumstances.


    Jamie Parson named Interim Chief Diversity Officer
    Thursday, May 6, 2021
    Dear Members of the App State Community,

    I am pleased to announce that Jamie Parson has agreed to serve as Interim Chief Diversity Officer, beginning May 10, 2021.

    Jamie’s leadership with diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at App State is well-known, and she is widely respected on our campus and nationally. Jamie has consistently built diversity, equity and inclusion work into her research, scholarship and service. Jamie will begin in her new role prior to Dr. Willie Fleming’s June 1 retirement. I appreciate her willingness to take on this cabinet-level position at this time so the important work we have underway continues seamlessly.


    Message from Chancellor Sheri Everts
    Friday, April 30, 2021
    Wednesday’s tragic incident that took the lives of two courageous Watauga County Sheriff’s deputies and two App State alumni has shocked and saddened the Appalachian Community. Sgt. Chris Ward and K-9 Deputy Logan Fox died in the line of duty, willingly risking their own safety to protect others. Michelle Wilson Ligon ’94 and George Ligon ’86 were well known and active participants in both the App State and Boone communities. We mourn these terrible losses.

    Remarks from the April 26, 2021 Faculty Senate Meeting
    Tuesday, April 27, 2021
    Good afternoon, and thank you, Michael.

    I’d like to begin by thanking all of you who have made it a priority to share your input on the search for the university’s next Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor. I’ve met with the Deans, the Council of Chairs, and with several key stakeholder groups, including representatives from this Senate, to hear your thoughts. Your perspectives on past searches and the process for moving forward have been very helpful, so thank you. I’m continuing to hold these meetings, and will keep you informed.


    Important message from Chancellor Sheri Everts and the Chancellor's Cabinet
    Tuesday, April 20, 2021
    Dear Members of our Campus Community,

    With the announcement of the Derek Chauvin verdict, please remember there are spaces set up for you to react and process the trial’s outcome. In addition to the resources we shared yesterday:

    Drop-in meetings for students will be held in-person (socially distanced), and virtually, beginning at 7pm tonight, and they will continue over the coming days. View a schedule of events for students here.

    Open forums for faculty and staff will be facilitated this week by the Inclusive Excellence Team. View a schedule of events for faculty and staff here.


    Important support and resources for our campus — a message from Chancellor Sheri Everts and the Chancellor's Cabinet
    Monday, April 19, 2021
    Dear Members of our Campus Community,

    Nearly a year after the death of George Floyd, our nation awaits the verdict of the trial of Derek Chauvin for Floyd's murder. At the same time, we continue to grapple with multiple tragedies that disproportionately affect our Black, Brown, Asian, Native and other underrepresented populations. Bearing the burden of anguish, the gripping frustration and the responsibility to be part of a solution and a support system are responsibilities all of us in the App State community share. We hold a collective commitment to looking deeply at our institution and its history, practices and beliefs, and working to institutionalize equity and inclusion into the fabric of our university community.


    Important Message from Chancellor Everts
    Monday, March 29, 2021
    Dear Faculty, Staff and Students,

    It is with personal regret but warm wishes that I announce Dr. Willie Fleming has shared with me that he will retire from App State effective June 1, 2021.

    Willie has held the position of Chief Diversity Officer since May 2016 – the first cabinet-level, Chief Diversity Officer position at App State. During this time, our university has benefited from his work with campus departments, committees and student organizations, as well as from the trainings he has conducted for more than 90% of the academic departments, and his leadership in developing the university’s Strategic Diversity Plan. Yet, as many on our campus know, his diversity and inclusion work at App State spans nearly 40 years.


    Remarks from the March 26, 2021 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, March 26, 2021
    Good Afternoon,

    It has been more than a year since this board began meeting virtually to comply with COVID safety precautions. Four hundred and thirty-two days ago, campus planning discussions first started around COVID-19, and it has been 380 days since our Emergency Operation Center formally activated to coordinate our preparedness, response and recovery efforts.

    I cannot express how proud I am of the efforts of our staff, in particular, to help keep our campus safe and healthy, our operations running and our university strong and prepared for post-pandemic operations during the most challenging year in university history.


    Remarks from the March 9, 2021 Staff Senate Meeting
    Thursday, March 18, 2021
    Good afternoon. I always look forward to sharing university updates with this hard-working and enthusiastic group. 

    I am also pleased that Scott Lampe, the chair of our Board of Trustees, is able to join us today. You will hear from him shortly. Thank you for being here, Chair Lampe!

    I want to begin by thanking everyone who supported iBackAPP Day last week. Our Vice Chancellor for University Advancement reports this was our most successful iBackApp day yet!  We generated nearly $250,000, with more than 2,350 donors. Countless more Mountaineers showed their support by wearing black and gold and by sharing their pride and love for App State on social media. I saw many of the departments here today join in this important day for the university. Thank you!

    Remarks from the December 4, 2020 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, December 4, 2020
    Good afternoon.

    A week from today, we will celebrate our second virtual commencement. I know we are all looking forward to a time when we will be able to celebrate this ultimate commemoration of our students’ academic achievement in person again. Our December graduates have earned one of the most significant achievements of their lifetimes under historically challenging circumstances: two consecutive semesters overshadowed by a global pandemic unlike anything the world has seen in more than a century.


    Important announcement from Chancellor Everts
    Tuesday, September 29, 2020
    Dear Faculty, Staff, Students, Parents, and Families,

    It is with the deepest sadness that I share with you that one of our students, Chad Dorrill, has died.

    The hearts of the entire Appalachian Community are with Chad’s family and loved ones during this profoundly difficult and painful time. Tributes shared by friends and loved ones show the positive impact Chad had on the communities he loved and called home, which included App State and Boone .


    Remarks from the September 25, 2020 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, September 25, 2020
    Good morning and welcome to our board members and to Governor Byers, who are joining us in the room today as well as those who are joining via Zoom.

    I’d like to begin by thanking Chair Blackburn for his exceptional leadership of this board during an extraordinary two years for App State. John, thank you for your dedication to our students, faculty and staff. I believe I can speak for everyone present when I say our appreciation of your dedication, service and leadership will continue long beyond your chairmanship of this board. Thank you.

    I’d also like to recognize and thank Rob Gelber and his AppTV team for broadcasting today’s meeting. Our students are gaining important, real-world experience with today’s live broadcast, and I really appreciate their work, and Rob’s leadership.

    It is anything but a typical September in Boone, but I am very pleased to say we do have students on campus making the very best out of their extraordinary challenges. 


    Remarks from the Sept. 11, 2020 Faculty Senate Meeting
    Monday, September 21, 2020
    As I reflect on my comments to you at this time a year ago, it is hard to fathom how much has changed since last September.

    I want to begin by saying thank you to our faculty.

    We are in day two-hundred-and-thirty-seven of campus planning for COVID-19, and day one-hundred-ninety-nine of formal coordinated preparedness, response and recovery efforts. In my weekly messages, as well as the weekly operations updates, we share with campus and the families of our students the latest information about our continued campus response, planning and recovery efforts. 

    Each week of the Fall 2020 semester we complete is a significant accomplishment. Since March, we have re-envisioned, re-imagined and re-defined the university experience at App State. In the last six months, we have had to re-create what took those who came before us more than 120 years to develop. This effort has been nothing short of superhuman for both our staff and our faculty.

    Important message from Chancellor Everts about continuing university operations
    Monday, August 17, 2020
    As you have likely heard, this afternoon, UNC-Chapel Hill announced their campus will shift all undergraduate instruction to remote learning on Wednesday. This decision was made by the UNC System in consultation with UNC-Chapel Hill leadership, following a significant increase of COVID-19 infection clusters within that campus community during the first week of classes. This decision applies to UNC-Chapel Hill only.

    We are in constant communications with UNC System officials, as well as our local public health experts, to monitor conditions on our campus, and there are no immediate plans to change our course delivery methods at App State.


    Answering your COVID-19 questions: an open letter to faculty from Chancellor Everts and Interim Provost Norris
    Thursday, July 2, 2020
    Dear Members of the Faculty,

    Over the past few days, we have heard from many of you– in the form of several Faculty Senate resolutions as well as in response to the direct messages to faculty and the broad-based messages sent to campus. Please know we appreciate your passion about the myriad issues you have raised with us as well as your messages of support. We also appreciate and understand the concerns you have shared with us.


    Remarks from the June 26, 2020 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, June 26, 2020
    My March update to this board took place two weeks after we were forced by the global COVID-19 pandemic to make an abrupt move from teaching a majority of our classes face-to-face to teaching all of them online. Since that time, we completed the Spring 2020 semester, provided a flexible grading policy as an option for those students who suffered the most significant disruption and held a virtual commencement for more than 3,600 graduates that was virtually attended by a record-setting 27,000+ people from all 50 states.


    Broad cultural change takes all of us
    Monday, June 1, 2020
    I pledge continued, critical resources to the many areas across campus that are coming together and helping our community chart a path for continued change. We are becoming a stronger, more mindful, and more inclusive community of people who, individually and together, can make real and powerful changes in communities well beyond our campus.

    Message from Chancellor Everts to faculty
    Monday, March 30, 2020
    As we begin our second week of the strange “new normal” that has moved us online and put more physical distance among us than ever before in the history of our institution, I want you to know I recognize and appreciate the work you have done, and continue to do, to carry forward your teaching, research and service.


    Remarks from the March 27, 2020 Meeting of the Board of Trustees
    Friday, March 27, 2020
    As I give this report, I am deeply saddened by the circumstances in which we find ourselves. While we regularly train for numerous crises and disasters, the reality of leading our university through an extended global pandemic sets in with significant gravity at unexpected times throughout the process. We are simultaneously planning for every conceivable scenario, responding to each new circumstance, and learning to anticipate every eventuality as the ground continues to shift beneath our feet.

    Next week, App State students will put their time to a variety of uses during spring break: working, studying, participating in one of the university’s Alternative Service Experiences and visiting with family and friends.

As our students prepare to travel for spring break, we encourage consideration of CDC and State Department guidance.

    Happy New Year, Mountaineers! Your support of Appalachian helped power many of our key moments in 2019 — from our Founders Day celebrations to the construction of a home for a local family in need. It was great to connect with you at signature events throughout the year, including on campus at Homecoming, and in many off-campus locations as well, including New Orleans, when the Mountaineers football team won its fifth straight bowl game. We appreciate all the ways you show your pride for Appalachian — on and off campus.

    Our university also loves to share your successes. Our more than 130,000 living alumni illustrate the infinite possibilities of an Appalachian education — from cooking with celebrities, to driving the future of sustainable automotive design, to illuminating stories on stage.

    Fall semester is in full swing and your students are settling into their classes, which are rigorous and designed to push them to think critically and creatively. The beginning of each semester is always a good time to remind students of the robust resources our university provides to help them succeed. These offerings - many of them guided by our stellar faculty - include early academic interventions, wellness and prevention services, financial aid assistance and career counseling, and contribute to Appalachian's impressive retention rate, which is well above the national average. We help students establish a foundation for success that lasts a lifetime.

Stay up to date on all the changes on the Appalachian's Future website. It is always a pleasure to hear stories of how our alumni - nearly 97,000 of whom reside in North Carolina - are using their Appalachian education to enhance their professions, elevate their communities and make real and powerful contributions.

I think our returning students will be amazed by the significant progress we made over the summer on our construction projects.

    While some of our Appalachian students take advantage of the summer break for travel, internships, summer jobs and quality time with their families, many are on campus for summer sessions. Summer classes make good sense for a number of reasons: They keep students fresh and in learning mode, often shorten the time to graduation and improve retention rates. Helping your student stay on track academically, emotionally and financially is always a priority for our faculty and staff, and there are bountiful services and resources available.

    Wednesday, June 13, 2018
    It’s been 50 years since Appalachian State Teachers College became Appalachian State University — a multidisciplinary, university with three undergraduate colleges: Arts and Sciences, Fine and Applied Arts, and Education. Some of you recall classes in the then-new Sanford Hall, seeing Doc Watson at the Boone Drug counter and maybe grabbing an ice cream sundae at the Tastee Freez — for a staggering 19 cents!

    Important information related to Appalachian State University
    Thursday, February 5, 2015
    We have experienced many tragedies this academic year, and the loss of students last semester and this semester has been very hard on our entire community. The loss of student life is something we would like to address specifically. There has been much discussion in the media and on social media about numbers and causes of recent student deaths. Speculation has led to assumptions and generated many questions, so while Appalachian does not typically release the cause of death in individual cases involving students, we want to share the following in order to ensure our community is accurately informed.


    Important message
    Tuesday, January 20, 2015
    The news we received last night about the death of one of our students saddens me deeply. This was a devastating announcement for all of us, and I want to emphasize that there is no evidence to suggest any threat to the university community.

The official cause of death has not yet been determined; however, foul play is not suspected and there is no evidence to suggest there is any threat to the university community.
